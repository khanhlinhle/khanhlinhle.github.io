<p>I am an undergraduate student in Finance and Banking at Saigon University, HCMC, Vietnam.
I've been working as both part-time and full-time in numerous related fields such as Customer 
Service, Stock - Securities, Accountant and Administrator. I'm currently working as an intern
at KMS Technology, HCMC. FinTech is the main topic that I am pursuing. </p>

<p>As FinTech is growing to be a promising future for finance and currency, I found it's very 
interesting to study and research further about FinTech, especially Blockchain. As far as I 
researched, Blockchain will play an important role for our future in exchanging values and 
as a reliable currency, there is no need for institutions to make such exchanges with a 
lowest uncertainty among community. I believe in the idea of decentralization and reliability
is maintain using the community's power</p>
